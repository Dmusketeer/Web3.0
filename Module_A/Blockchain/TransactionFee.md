## What Are Bitcoin Transaction Fees?
- Mathematically, transaction fees are the difference between the amount of bitcoin sent and the amount received. 
- Conceptually, transaction fees are a reflection of the speed with which a user wants their transaction validated on the blockchain. 
- When a miner validates a new block in the blockchain, they also validate all of the transactions within the block.
