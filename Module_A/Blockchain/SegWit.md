# What Is Segregated Witness (SegWit)?
- Segregated Witness (SegWit) refers to a change in the transaction format of Bitcoin. Its stated purpose as a protocol upgrade was to protect against transaction malleability and decrease transaction times by increasing block capacity. Transaction malleability refers to the possibility that tiny pieces of transaction information could be changed, invalidating new cryptocurrency blocks.

- It was also intended to speed up the validation process by storing more transactions in a block.

## Understanding Segregated Witness (SegWit)

- The Bitcoin network consists of thousands of computers that work as validators for the blocks created by miners. These computers are called nodes, which each keep a complete record of every transaction. This record is called a blockchain.

- The Bitcoin network faced several problems as it matured. One was that more transactions were occurring, which added more blocks to the chain. Blocks are created every 10 minutes and used to be constrained to a maximum size of one megabyte (MB).Due to this constraint, only a certain number of transactions could be added to a block.
