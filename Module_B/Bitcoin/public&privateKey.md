## What Are Public and Private Keys?

- crypto wallet comes with two keys: a public key and a private key.

## Public keys
- The public key is used to send cryptocurrency into a wallet. The private key is used to verify transactions and prove ownership of a blockchain address. If someone sends you, say one bitcoin (BTC), a private key will be required to “unlock” that transaction and prove that you are now the owner of that bitcoin.

- Think of your public key as your mailing address. Anyone can look it up and send things, in this case cryptocurrency, to that address. It's similar to providing your checking account number and routing number to set up a direct deposit – you can tell that information to anyone, but it doesn't allow them to withdraw money or otherwise log in to your account.

# Private keys
- The private key on the other hand is for the wallet owner only. The private key functions as a password to your crypto wallet and should be kept secret. The thing you must understand is that if someone discover your private key, they will have access to all the crypto in that wallet and can do whatever they want with it.
